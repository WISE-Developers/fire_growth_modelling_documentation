### 1 Updates from Neal - Work between Franco, Rob, Neal - Pending Tasks for Rob

Moving to Zenhub, redmine is gone. We've been moving to GitHub. Issues can be lodged through the website or directly from the Github. In terms of workload and assignment we have begun using ZenHub

### 2 Abstract Submission for WFC
   
Submitted waiting to hear back - 20 minute presentation telling the story of the vision to the modernized version of the tool.


### 3 Sorted out budget at CIFFC
   1. Working on setting up mini-sprints


### 4 Brett - Officialization of role within PSaaS

Setting up my position with this project as an official work item, this is an effort to bring things up to the national level more officially. Also trying to get 10k pushed to the project annually. 

Neal - Started with a committee for a national tool, everyone left, AB left with the bag. Alleviate single agency from holding the bag as this is a national tool. This work under AB was a sole source method and we are working on moving away from that and moving towards a community. More stakeholders looking to become a part of the tool and contribute. We are no longer an agency contracting a software developer. Encouraged by this development.

Franco - This was also about setting someone up in an official capacity to begin generating a state of the project report.

Neal - This conversation isn't over, it'll keep going, we need somewhere to house this tool and have better national coordination.

### 5 Franco - Rebranding issue

The fact that we are rebranding should not be news. Moving to WISE from PSaaS as WISE actually tells you what it does "Wildfire Intelligence and Simulation Engine". I also think we need to agree to this right away, as the process for rebranding will take some time and a lot of work.

Proposition - Using the name WISE. (So I can begin the ground work for the rebrand)
        - No objection to moving ahead as WISE

   1. Neal - how I approach talking about PSaaS knowing there is a rebrand coming. Never referred to it as PSaaS or named it anything in particular to allow the re-brand to speak for itself.
