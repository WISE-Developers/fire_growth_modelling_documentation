### 1. New Build Beta.4

Completed the new zealand work, its now in Beta 4. Likely a bad time for NZ as they are busy but the obligation has been fulfilled. Tests all passed.

With every build we do we learn and tweak.

### 2. Git Workflow

Utilizing the git workflow. Using a script to build all the dev branches. 3 stream system, dev, prod and UAT, UAT is automated and prod is static, but UAT is a mirror of prod. This is a structure to allow us to merge in code that passes dev testing but isn't pushed to prod until UAT is completed.

### 2a. Prometheus EOL

Testing for the new structure within Prometheus is succeeding.
[Action] - Close out issues in GitHub as they are completed. @lizzydchappy

Not running x64 version of Prometheus.

When are we going to say hey, time to crush EOL Prom?

Use this working version through the summer to find the bugs. Bugs found can be funded by Alberta with direct contracting. Working toward getting Release Candidate 1 out maybe even before fire season.

### 3. Team Progress

A number of new teams have been created and there are volunteering locations in discord. Teams are being duplicated in GitHub with linkages to Discord that will allow information to flow regardless of where you are working. These teams will be self starters and need people to push for action.

### 4. Governance and Exec

3 years in and we are keeping on keeping on. Exec is changing. A lot of project management and structures have resulted in a lot of progress of late. We've turned huge corners over the years and we're starting to get into a position of a strong project.

A lot of change, a lot of progress. The kinds of pushes we've made are not sustainable and will need the rest of the team to push also. Moving towards a community model rather than individual pushes. Looking to see the Canadian Fire Community to get into programming for our systems.

Moving away from an exec committee to a steering committee, haven't figured that out but its in the works. One of the big topics is funding. CIFFC is moving into a business phase were we have an admin fee and an SLA as would other projects.

### 5. Attention to the Project

Nick came back once he saw the project go live. This demonstrates that people are watching.
