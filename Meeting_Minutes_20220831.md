### 1. Franco update

_Franco_ - Not a lot of development. Did do some things with the CFS modeller. Mostly been doing operational modelling. Update on CFS dip modeller?

_Robert_ - Thanks, up in Azure, working instance in kubernetes, cutter and modeller. It's been dumping information to a shared area. Challenge is that we need a public IP to get things out of k8s. Deployed into a webapp but they are more restrictive and it keeps the containers locked in very prescriptively.

_Franco_ - Back at it, glad to hear there was some growth on this. Voice is busted up so I wont be at the conference.

### 2. Albertas experience using automated modelling

_Liz_ - For reference back int eh spring AB entered into a research project. Compare the automatic outputs to reality. Used outputs from multiple NWP models and perimeters from a number of provinces and territories. Using firecast to run these models. Inputs were gathered by AB, fuels, igns, wx data. Outputs were realistic but not perfect. Needed to be more specific to alberta to get better outputs. Burning conditions were specific to alberta, green up, curing etc. Couldn't assess the performance of firecast. Issues were around the weather and the fire polygon. Also modelling fires in the yukon, sk, and nwt. Created a performance issue. Seemed like firecast burned too big too fast. YT likes using the autmated modelling. Challenges around fine scae modelling.

_Brett_ - If there are a lot of changes being made we really need staff to log the changes they are making so we can better teach the system how to make good choices.

_Neal_ - As these first implementations of WISE were there is a resistance because "we can't let it run automatically" because of all the things we need to fix. "Machine learning" problems (bretts comment, not an ML problem, data accuracy/cleanliness problem). US has other platforms and we can go into deeper detail with.

### 3. Conference

_Neal_ - Still don't have travel approval. There is an option to present remotely. Not sure I'm a fan of that, but we'll determine one way or another yet. TBD how we are going to deal with this.

### 4. Name

It's WISE now.
