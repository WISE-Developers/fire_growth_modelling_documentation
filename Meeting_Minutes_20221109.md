### 1. Conference update from Rob

Focused on modelling talks. Marc had a really great intro to the conference. Lots of interesting challenges with CC and reburn. Chris Rodell had a great talk too. 3 or 4 talks on tools using / planning to use WISE. Going to be a landmark tool. Attended Bretts talk, it was uncomfortable and good. 

Talk about moving FWI to solar time. [This may occur in CWFIS too]

Kris Johnson there and very positive.

Ellen Whitman really great talk and landmark work.

Good technology there, WFS coming online in the coming 5 years, very exciting.

Fire prediction models in some of the booths.

[Rob K] - Interesting conference. Lots of good stuff for saskatchewan.
