# Exec Agenda

## 1.) Our WFC presentation is scheduled for Nov 3 from 2:50 to 3:10 PM. We're the second last presentation on the last day of the conference. We have the option to pre-record our presentation

**Pre-recorded presentations must be submitted to the Speaker Portal by Oct 24.**

All presenters are required to register and pay for the conference. I will do this if there is an option to attend remotely. I would otherwise like to identify Brett as the lead author. We need to decide if we're proceeding with a pre-recorded presentation. If so, I'm going to get started and will schedule several blocks of time with both of your to finish this over the next 3 weeks.

_Brett_ - If we drop out, slides for the CFS booth deck?

_Franco_ - Been building a lot of this variety of material anyway. So this can easily be oriented into WISE info products. My vote, dump WFC, focus on WC and provide slides for the CFS booth which is dual purpose for the webinar.

## 2.) We are scheduled for a Canada Wildfire webinar on November 18 at 09:30 MST. Canada Wildfire would like to start advertising the webinar and requires the following information: (1) presentation title, (2) brief description/abstract, (3) brief bio. I'm much more excited about this Canada Wildfire webinar as we'll have a captive audience from across Canada

_Neal_ - Need to provide title, abstract and bio.

_Title_ - W.I.S.E. A Smarter Way of Modelling Fire

_Abstract_ -

_Bios_ -
Brett Moore - Wildfire Application Developer - Project guidance through experience manually probabilistic modelling with Prometheus. Operating fire models for 12 years, working closely with CFFDRS team as well.

## 3.) Should we follow up with Dave Schroeder, Jonathan Boucher, and Robert Bryce regarding how they represent WISE in their WFC presentation? I think we should. I would like them all to mention that their software is using prototype software that is not yet publicly available. I would also like them to avoid referring to PSaaS so they can help us with our WISE rebranding effort. Finally, they could also help advertise for our Nov 18 Canada Wildfire webinar

_Neal_ - 4x this 1x effort. 3 presenters talking about W.I.S.E., efforts made should be to these folks Dave, Jon and Rob in order to get them ready to talk about WISE. Dave re Firecast, Jon re FireHawk, Rob re FireCast. Get all of them to drop hints to the webinar in November.

_Franco_ - Prepared to make slides / docs on wise terms, attribution and docs. Fire off 1 pagers with the information we are looking to get them aware of, logos, signage etc.

_Brett_ - Talk to all 3 at once imo.

_Neal_ - web meeting? Email?

_Franco_ - Need time to build up assets, but then yes, web meeting would be wise.

_Neal_ - Oct 17-21 planning to do this meeting.
