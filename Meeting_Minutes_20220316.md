Agenda

# 1. Firegrowthmodel.ca help

PhD student out of london looking for help with the COM, looking to integrate Prometheus into C# application. Have instantiated but are having a hard time using it. 

_Rob_ - should use the interop

# 2. Presenting to BC and Canada Wildfire

Target end of life announcement in April ideally. Imminent release, next release is EOL.

# 3. Website update

_Franco_ - I've been working on all of the websites. That means the 2 prototype websites for PSaaS, the migration of RedAPP. Firegrowthmodel.ca and Redapp.com have been updated and will get moved into the github pages universe in time. Another barrier, need a GitHub account to report a bug. End of the day GitHub will solve the majority of our support requests rather than routing to a single email.

## 3.1. Analytics on Software Grabbing

How do we go about having informing our business justification but also serving the users the most effectively.

## 3.2. Website Direction

_Franco_ - Currently no good way to deliver direction on where the website is to go.

# 5. Alberta Contract Update

_Liz_
2 contracts

1) Hard set deliverables - currently underway
2) Grant for CIFFC going ahead at this time

## 5.1 General contract info
_Rob_
Access and keys for different repos. GitHub doesn't have intel compiler but does have clang, so that's good. Cleaning up the code along the way, specifically the V6 spefic stuff.

# 6. Governance update

Over the next while you'll see some changes to structure in discord and github and how we expect to use tools now and in the future. 

GitHub Teams - to attach the permissions required such as automatic builds, the group will need to be reformatted to ensure permissions are appropriate by individual and role. 

_Neal_ - into the repos and project areas now. Wanted to come back to the previous conversations about issues and bugs. Wanted to report an issue on the PSaaS installer, there's also a change over from RedMine to GitHub. Are we moved over to GitHub now?

_Franco_ - Yes we've moved over, RedMine will stay up, but we will no longer be using it for reporting and tracking.

** After Brett left **
1) Rob updated the team on the NWT COntract
2) Rob updated the team on the AB COntract
