### 1) teams work


Teams are now established. Davinci has been updated to allow for specific notification for support items to teams.

### 2) Wise Beta

Still not there yet.
Bug 180 Open Sourcing issues. Many of the components in WISE are build from private repos in HSS. For example multithreading.
Bug 171 Thought it was solved, red herring. If you install Ubuntu on computer it can't run WISe as there is a needed libgomp available. Work around was to install this lib. Flawed test was the test that said the bug was fixed. Build essentials was installing the lib so it caused a false pass.
Bug 167 RedApp no build.

### 3) Open Collective

A method for housing funding.

### 4) Testing Protocol

New protocol, fits the agile protocol ish.

### 5) my status red

Intellifire issues not being solved. More team involvement on WISE required.

### 6) Ciffc ToR

We've paid our admin fee. Came out to around 3.75% but they did it part way through. Working with Van on getting things paid out.

### 7) GitHub team discussions

Moving discussions to project_issues repo
