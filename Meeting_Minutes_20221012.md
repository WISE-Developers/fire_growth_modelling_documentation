### 0. Change in general

Conference, Canada Wildfire in Nov.

WISE - the rename begins, and its a bucket of work.

Not presenting directly at WFC this year. We will be making a presentation more along the lines of the WISE project itself.

[Action] - Email Franco with when you got into the project. This is for constructing a project timeline.

### 1. Prometheus end of life

File distribution, installer

As we know there is no support for Prometheus something that will break will be the dependencies.

_Franco_ - pre-reqs will be maintained along side the software in situ.

_Brett_ - perhaps we provide a container that allows for us to provide windows as prometheus requires.

### 2. Zenhub

_Franco_ - Last week Liz dove into ZenHub and we basically dropped her in!

_Liz_ - Poked around but wasn't really able to find the roadmap for my business case to move funds to CIFFC.
