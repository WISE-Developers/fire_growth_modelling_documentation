# Exec Agenda

## 1. Budget

Have 25k remaining. Possible we can get GNWT dollars again.

Future of the budget via Van. Sorting out this admin fee. Any money contributed tot his project will have 5% taken off the top, after than they will pay any invoices from any vendor. If this tool was "important" more agencies would be paying for it.

Toolbox intent has been warped and now we don't have the structure that was intended. CIFFC could be playing a role to sort out funding and where dollars for toolbox endeavours go. CIFFC only supports short term projects.

RedApp is the banner that is either being supported or shut down. Next is WISE. Bringing to IM/IT to define a funding structure. Willing is good, otherwise we may need to crowd fund for this tool.

## 2. Closed source libs

## 3. Alberta

Prometheus is a ciffc project last license AB is custodian
We are in the process of excising closed source info
WISE is next gen Prom it'll be FOSS, your help will make that happen faster
More than just code, if we give you the code, you get to end of life the project. This includes ownership of the EoL, documentation, support, website, all the things.
Our preference is to work together to generate open source tools rather than proprietary issues.
