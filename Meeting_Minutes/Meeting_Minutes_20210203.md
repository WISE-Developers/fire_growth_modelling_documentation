### 1 The proposal

Changes to:
 - how we version
 - how we do releases
 - how work is happening
 - how to forecast and answer questions
Acceptance of this proposal will allow us to simplify and generate a future work plan nearly automatically.
Goal of this is the provide clarity to a number of the questions we are struggling to answer.
Timed releases rather than performance based releases.

To be discussed at next meeting in 2 weeks
- [ ] Get the document out to the team for next week
- [ ] Add examples into the document for the team
- [ ] Add examples of how we would migrate from Redmine to GitHub
