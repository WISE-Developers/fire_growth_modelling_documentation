# 1. Priorities

Where are we at with the pre-WISE backlog?

Nearly done, just need a quote on the protobuf incorporation from Rob.

Neal - Using the recent V of prom, some UI bugs that weren't there previously.
    - Can't draw in weather / fuel patches.
    - Can draw point/line/poly fires.
  
    - Requirements are no longer in alignment with reality for RedApp.

Brett - Properly set up sprints?

Franco - Yes

# 2. Liz Issue 113

https://github.com/PSaaS-Developers/Project_issues/issues/113

This may have been resolved but is only in a development build. Potentially need it pushed out in a public release.

Open an FGMJ generated by Firecast it crashes prometheus upon save. But it wasn't noticed by one of the specialists. This is already fixed due to the latest PSaaS being used operationally.

Franco - new bugs haven't been worked on yet. If we push an already existing build as a release it will only solve one problem and not the others. 

# 2.5 Round Table

Rob - report issue with 7 on producing grid exports

https://github.com/PSaaS-Developers/Project_issues/issues/90

6 and 7, 7 is a lot slower exporting some things. #90 is a feature request to improve performance.

This is worth reporting as the time loss makes the tool unusable.

# 3. Outstanding Triage

#105 - Moving to WISE backlog (Needs plan and estimate)
#106 - Rearchitecting world locations and timezones (Needs plan and estimate)
#108 - Missing value in LUT results in odd error (Needs plan and estimate)
#109 - Bring V6 caching into V7 to improve performance (Needs plan and estimate)
#110 - Remove stats inside ignition polygons (Needs plan and estimate)
#113 - Resolved in a more current build, add to the next public release. (Done Not Billable)
#117 - Auto-stop fire growth (Needs plan and estimate)

# 4. Backlog Grooming

Latest sprint wrapping up, what are the latest items that are in a backlog that we can get after next.
