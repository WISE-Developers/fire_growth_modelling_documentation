## Code Merges

Several problems holding back the basic build. It would not build, a few issues with access tokens preventing the construction. WISE side problem is permanently solved but the HSS side is not. Permanent solution went from fine access token with an expiration to a more general token.

If they have not properly removed HSS code we will see it when the token expires again and we will know where the issue is coming from.

These tokens were necessary in the first place due to public pulls from private locations.

All things related to this code base must be open and accessible. Nothing else.

Ready to begin merging work into the main tree as the build is working again.

Fixing these issues will be done on their time as it needs to be a functional feature prior to acceptance of completion.

Dependabot PR management system - how are we going to deal with different severity levels.
Suggestion to pull once a month 30 days behind.

## NRC Meeting

## Status of Independence

## CIFFC Conversation

April 16 is the next meeting for CIFFC / WISE. Would like to talk early, but that's really quick and Neal wants to be prepared.Better approach would be to get together with them, the fire science and IM/IT working groups. This is essentially a non-starter as getting them all together would be very difficult.

Franco - why don't we draft a letter, we can get that out much sooner and have the desired groups be in the know. Gives an opportunity to allow them to reach out directly too. 

CIFFC is welcome to contribute.
