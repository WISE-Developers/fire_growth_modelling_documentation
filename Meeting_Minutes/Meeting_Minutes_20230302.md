# Agenda

## Attendees

### 1. Alex's bug

Important bug in the WISE system if it actually is a bug. Either fix the bug or tell him how writing needs to be done for it to function. The role of MQTT has fundamentally changed and Alex's leveraging may over tax the MQTT. Alex is attempting to move the input files around via MQTT. In that process, one of the MQTT clients drops early (builder currently). Lots of discussions on-going.

### 2. Dev build system

Real build process leaves a mark, dev build is trying to do things without leaving a mark. Currently working on getting the 3 prong system together, Prod, Dev, UAT.

### 3. New Project Prometheus EOL - channel

Do or don't? I say do! Dedicated project for the Prometheus EOL project. This is to manage pollution. Migrated issues to the new repo. We will build a channel in discord.

Checkboxes are issuifiable, you can use these as an issue aggregator.

- [Action] A GitHub workshop to show folks how to do things.

### 4. Asking about WISE and Fire Season

How do I give a client a stable version? The latest release will always be the most stable version of the tool. Pre-release will be available for beta features.

### 5. WISE on Windows

Stable is latest.
