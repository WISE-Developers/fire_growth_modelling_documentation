Looking to eliminate ad hoc payment of items. Laundry list of items we are be paying for annually as agencies.

- Hosting expense of FGM.ca/.com - AB
- SSL certificate for websites - AB
- RedApp Domain - NWT

### 2. Rob - Linux vs Windows

NUMA node issue. Linux is far better at scheduling threads and processes than Windows, we can effectively double the throughput in Linux. Started doing to the comparison of V6 to V7 and building that infrastructure and we will be able to do a direct comparison soon. 6-12 threads in Linux allowing it to move more information more efficiently.

## Work in progress

### 1. Life in ZenHub

Introduced to the tool once Neal started with BC. This is a software for managing issues and work currently being worked on. This allows us to use pipelines to determine what we're working on and when. Moves through pipelines as progress is made.

### 2. Rob work specifically

2 in Done, any comments on these? Clients sign off on the work so I don't close I just assign to done. This would allow for a mutual agreement on the completion of this work. 

We are looking to sort out the flow. Discussed in progress items and where the devs were at on them.

## Upcoming
