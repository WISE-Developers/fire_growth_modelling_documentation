##  3. <a name='MetwithRandy'></a>Met with Randy

Talking about his potential involvement in team going forward.

##  4. <a name='BCComingOnlinewithPSaaS'></a>BC Coming Online with PSaaS

Driving toward first release. Biggest roadblock is licensing and ownership. Open code bases will be attractive to other developers. Not a lot of additional functionality, licensing, ownership, validation.
