### 1. Assests

We have an assets repo for all things badging / iconography. Lots of changes in github as we work on the challenges building.

First off the public assets location. We have logos, badges and all other manner of assets. Basic graphics for now.They can be seen on the site as to how they would look on a website as well as code to source the logo from our website. This allows you to always have the most up to date logo in your material. Its self automated.

It will contain attribution guidelines as well. This will be some copy/paste information for them to be able to attribute properly. Looking to the team to help with the development of this document. Leveraging github to develop this material and version control. The guidelines are for how users are expected to demonstrate their use of the tool. Provides guidelines for visual identity.

### 2. Workflows

If you're not familiar with how our GitHub system is working for us, the source code written by HSS gets compiled for us to have an executable. This has been migrated into GitHub to allow all this to happen without a human in the loop. The next step is to allow us to design automated testing. Everything is then tracked in github so we can see how things progress.

### 3. Builds

Now have been 4 builds available to the world. Moving forward when a bug is filed against the code we then need to reproduce the bug in a test, from there we can work towards a bug fix. Once this passes we can then check the code builds into the future. Once the test passes successfully the system can close the bug on our behalf.

### 4. Website

Small but important change: after having put the url to the WISE project I thought maybe I would go in and make the URL less imposing.

### 5. EOL Prometheus

Have a standing version that is newer and compatible with WISE outputs. Would like to get a version to Liz for testing. Are there any issues with giving this to her to test?

[Action] - Franco - Get a copy of Prometheus over to Liz asap.
