### 1. Liz Prometheus Update

Liz tested P in real time
 Good compatible with firecast
 bad, still lingering issues with wise compatibility.
 KML exporting from P to kml
 crashing due to GDAL
 crashing root cause intelcompiler.
 line ignitions the scenario would crash blank.

only bugs left:

1. occasionally cant draw ignitions.
Provided FGMJ and workflow to Rob.

2. hourly fwi issue - manual entry of fwi, not working. stats are odd.

Plan: meeting with HSS/AB tomorrow.

ROB - Axed the intel compiler and gained stability and lost performance
Prometheus is currently an RC so when its fixed, its ready for Neal to release.

### 2. New Tickets

2 new tickets regarding AB/BC/ON bug, hffmc values rising going back in time.
intent was never to start at 5pm and go back to midnight.
Vanwagner climbs and Lawson has hiccups. (noon and 4pm)
As long as we go backwards like this, we will have this issue.
However:
Rob: Kerry Andersons Equilibum approach works and looks best at this time.
or at least works better relatively.
Rob wants to use this approach. Neal is not currently supporting this.

## last thoughts...

Rob: Heard good things out of Alaska - CFFDRS, and shrubs.
Franco: Lux Moving forward may be modelling in the next week
