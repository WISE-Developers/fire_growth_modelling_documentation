### 1. Liz Funding Transfer to CIFFC

Questions around zenhub and transparency on funding.

_Neal_ - Essentially ZenHub is a gui to allow for ineraction with GitHub. What you see here is what you would see in our GitHub but this is formatted in a way that makes it easier to observe what is going on. We have pipelines that sort our work so we can track where things are at. We have a backlog which are just ideas that we have not yet worked on.

_Franco_ - Will put in instructions to add the zenhub plugin for folks.

_Neal_ - Tool is very useful for determing where the project is at. Automatic responses for folks asking questions. Transparency and accountability will be reported around CIFFC agencies and not agencies beyond that.

_Franco_ - Just because we are open source does not mean our finances are open to the world. If you or your agency is contributing you will be kept up to date on your money.

### 2. Wildland Fire Canada

_Neal_ - Not going to be there.

_Rob_ - Overlap and making sure we can do things?

_Neal_ - Our presentation generally was about the journey/experience of managing an open source side of the desk national modelling project.
