- GNWT is a member of Canada Wildfire. Franco will investigate is this option is acceptable for GNWT.

# Wildfire Resilient Futures Initiative

-Open source WISE
-EOL Prometheus
-A working example of WISE implementation
-Abstraction API for all models in the CWFMF.
-Developer documentation and unit testing
-New modern interface for guided automation modelling by fire behaviour specialists (human-in-the-loop).
-Median fire behaviour statistics (tabular and raster)
-Spotting module
-Wind gusting
-National Dataset for WISE implementation FBP fuels.
integration of CWFMF weather forecast service. Expand weather service to include all NWM sources and modify models to use raw NWM outputs in raster format.
-Self-tuning weather models based on observation network (auto-tune).
-Next generation CFFDRS implementation
-Machine learning for fire growth modelling (self-tuning fire spread models).
