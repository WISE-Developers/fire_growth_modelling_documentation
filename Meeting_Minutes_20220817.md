## 1. Discussion Around Testing

How to do testing for PSaaS specifically in the future.
Neal could provide methodology and a dataset but can't actually test it.

The whole team has some capacity to perform some testing. Brett would like to set up some protocols to ensure MQTT setup is consistent.

One thing we really need to do more of is to establish ways of testing what you need tested to ensure there is a specific test with data provided.

## 2. Brad, update on where we are with final version of Prometheus, 1st version of WISE

We do have a bit of a desired timeline, but our ability to achieve that is as always dependent on funding and external unknowns. Not a lot of funding this year and are moving slower and more carefully. A few items remain in Zenhub to get us to end of life Proemtheus. WISE timing is basically V1 ready for Wildland Fire Canada.

Prometheus EOL for Conference. Followup talk with Canada Wildfire at the UofA to be a good spot to actually release WISE.

_Rob_ - Formal adoption of the license. Lots of work to get up onto GitHub.

## 3. Robert working on dip modeller on azure and kubernetes, quick update there

Able to get the dip modeller up and running in kubernetes. Still has some confusion on how to set it up so that we can see things on its internal mapping tool. Interim been attemption to deploy it as an azure webapp, these are quite constrained and managed and we need to be very careful on our configuration. So far looking pretty good!
